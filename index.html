            <p>
              As mentioned in the
              <a href="/code/2016/04/05/erfa-wrapping-extension/">previous</a>
              <a href="/code/2016/03/25/gsoc-proposal/">post</a>, I applied for
              GSoC 2016 under
              <a href="http://openastronomy.org/">OpenAstronomy</a>, but my
              <a href="/code/2016/03/25/gsoc-proposal/">proposal</a> was
              rejected.<br />
              I gave my best effort to the community and my GSoC proposal, but
              in the end, it wasn’t sufficient. I really felt heartbroken after
              the result but as they say
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Here are some lessons I learnt from this rejection:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Always try to apply in 2-3 organizations, giving your best in
                each and every one. Because no matter how hard and excellent
                your work is, things could go south because of many reasons like
                fewer slots, good competition etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                Try to ask for feedback from your mentors. I asked for feedback
                from my mentor and he mentioned that they need students who
                could write mostly correct code and could work without less
                feedback and help from mentors. I think the main culprit for me
                was this pull request
                <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/4551">#4551</a>
                in which I wasn’t able to completely understand the reviewer’s
                intent and needed more feedback and time of the mentor.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    This means that I need to improve upon code quality and
                    learn more of internal details in Python rather than just
                    basic working details. I am currently working on it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    But anyways I think using this as an argument based on the
                    limited interaction between mentor and student, to reject
                    the student is not good enough, as GSoC is meant for
                    students, not professionals and things like this(code
                    quality) are meant to improve gradually not stay the same.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Don’t take the rejection personally.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Hopefully, I would reapply next year with more hard work,
              excellent proposal and get selected.
