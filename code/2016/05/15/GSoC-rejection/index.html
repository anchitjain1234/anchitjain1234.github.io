          <p>
            As mentioned in the
            <a href="/code/2016/04/05/erfa-wrapping-extension/">previous</a>
            <a href="/code/2016/03/25/gsoc-proposal/">post</a>, I applied for
            GSoC 2016 under
            <a href="http://openastronomy.org/">OpenAstronomy</a>, but my
            <a href="/code/2016/03/25/gsoc-proposal/">proposal</a> was
            rejected.<br />
            I gave my best effort to the community and my GSoC proposal, but in
            the end, it wasn’t sufficient. I really felt heartbroken after the
            result but as they say
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Here are some lessons I learnt from this rejection:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Always try to apply in 2-3 organizations, giving your best in each
              and every one. Because no matter how hard and excellent your work
              is, things could go south because of many reasons like fewer
              slots, good competition etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Try to ask for feedback from your mentors. I asked for feedback
              from my mentor and he mentioned that they need students who could
              write mostly correct code and could work without less feedback and
              help from mentors. I think the main culprit for me was this pull
              request
              <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/4551">#4551</a>
              in which I wasn’t able to completely understand the reviewer’s
              intent and needed more feedback and time of the mentor.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This means that I need to improve upon code quality and learn
                  more of internal details in Python rather than just basic
                  working details. I am currently working on it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  But anyways I think using this as an argument based on the
                  limited interaction between mentor and student, to reject the
                  student is not good enough, as GSoC is meant for students, not
                  professionals and things like this(code quality) are meant to
                  improve gradually not stay the same.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Don’t take the rejection personally.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Hopefully, I would reapply next year with more hard work, excellent
            proposal and get selected.
          </p>
